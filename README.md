# VisualKube

1. Simple, easy-to-use, product-oriented application deployment platform 

2. Cloud Native source-to-url application deployment, multiple environments and ci/cd 


VisualKube is a product-oriented CI/CD solution that companies use to reduce time to market and enhanced developer productivity and experience. It helps developers and product owners to release applications faster, run multiple versions in the same time and manage traffic across multiple versions. It comes along with full support for CI pipelines. VisualKube being “Cloud Native” means that it integrates seamlessly with the cloud native primitives so that the so that the user need not be an expert in installing, using, and maintaining these system. 

**Goals**

Deploying new applications and / or releasing new versions for existing ones should be fun, easy and accessible to agile team members. While Kubernetes and the existing cloud native technologies provides means of abstracting infrastructure and make developers life easier, they are not focused on the end goal of every product team: **Bring applications and features faster in front of the customers**. 

VisualKube is: 
1. Fun and Easy to use. Agile teams can use it to deploy applications. 

2. Portable. Can be deployed on existing Kubernetes clusters

3. Reliable. It integrates with existing cloud native technologies like Istio and Prometheus elimination painful integrations and custom tooling so that each user does not need to be and expert in the details. 



**Features**

1. Runs on top of your existing Kubernetes cluster, and it can integrate multiple kubernetes clusters. 

2. It integrates with your existing GIT version control provider like GitHub or GitLab  

3. It provides traffic management by integrating with Istio 

4. It supports custom defined workflows by creating CI/CD pipelines using a simple yaml file. Building workflows might be performed in the future from the web-interface 

5. It allows users to perform custom traffic management across multiple deployments enabling A/B testing and much more.

**Current Status**

VisualKube it’s in the product discovery phase. Currently we are aiming to: 
1. Understand agile teams needs while working to reduce time to market and increase developer productivity 

2. Select the features that will have the biggest impact. 

3. Build a prototype that users can work with 

4. Grow the product to become a standard in the Cloud Native CI/CD landscape.
